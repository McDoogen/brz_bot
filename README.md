# brz-bot
brz-bot is an experimentation with ROS 2, localization, and teleoperation! Fun! :D

# Parts Needed for Phase 2:


# Parts needed for Future Phases:
1. Battery Pack for Logic (5V)
2. Battery Pack for Motor (5V)
3. Improved Motor Battery connections (find JST...)
4. Improved Mount for Pi to Robot Base
5. Dynamixel Motors
    -> This will affect voltage needs as well
    -> This will need more space potentially meaning modifications to the robot base
    -> Check compatibility with Raspberry PI.
6. Ultrasonic Range Sensor Integration

Batteries can be 9V for a smaller footprint and then stepped down. What is the Voltage range for the PI?
